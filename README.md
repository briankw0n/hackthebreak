Hack the Job is a web application that helps users find relevant job postings. Rather than spending hours looking for the right job, users simply upload their resume or cover letter. In mere seconds, it searches through multiple job sites and returns jobs that best fit the user. 

Hack the Job is implemented purely with Python, including the UI and backend.

Although we had a rough start as this was our very first hackathon, we persevered and dedicated ourselves to completing our application within the 24-hour timeframe.

Some packages may need to be installed prior to runing this program. They can be installed through pip, a package installer for Python, using the following command: python -m pip install (package name)

Lastly, we want to thank the BCIT Computing Club, Women in Computing, and Coding for All for hosting Hack the Break 2023 and allowing us to participate in this exciting event! It was an incredible opportunity for us to learn new skills, collaborate with other talented individuals, and apply our knowledge to real-world problems in a limited amount of time.
